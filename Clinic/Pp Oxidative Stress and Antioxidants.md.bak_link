“All organisms living in an aerobic environment are constantly bombarded with an oxidative challenge posed by reactive oxygen and nitrogen (RONS) species” (Legendre et al., 2020, p. 2)

“. The movement of electron (e−) from the reduced nucleotides to O2 is a dangerous process as it promotes the formation of ROS (Shadel and Horvath 2015; Lemire et al. 2011). ROS and RNS accumulation in the cell lead to oxidative stress, a situation which has been linked to various physiological abnormalities including cellular death and diseases. Hence to mitigate the complications arising from an aerobic life-style, organisms have evolved intricate antioxidative defense strategies. These include enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), as well as ROS scavengers including vitamin C, vitamin E and glutathione (GSH).” (Legendre et al., 2020, p. 2)
