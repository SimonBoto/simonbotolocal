[[Metabolite Alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG)]] AKG has been shown to help combat [[cyanide]]  toxicity in a manner similar to how it prevents lipid peroxidation.

AKG can also bind to cyanide to produce cyanohydrin, a less toxic component, to fight off cyanide poisoning (Bhattacharya and Tulsawani 2009).”
