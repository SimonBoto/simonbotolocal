#definition 

[[Df minerals]] that exhibit effective thermal and electric conductivity. Characterized by malleability - wire, ductility - sheet, and high reflectivity of light - shining.

Approximately three-quarters of all known [[chemical elements]] are metals. 

The most abundant varieties in the Earth’s crust are [[aluminum]], [[Iron Fe]]
[[Calcium Ca]], [[Sodium Na]] [[Potassium K]], [[Calcium Ca]], [[Magnesium Mg]]. 

The vast majority of metals are found in ores (mineral-bearing substances), but a few such as [[Copper Cu]], [[Gold Au]], [[silver Si]] frequently occur in the free state because they do not readily react with other elements.
