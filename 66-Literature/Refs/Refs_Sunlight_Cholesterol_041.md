abstract: We investigated the relationship between geography and incidence of coronary heart disease, looking at deficiency of sunlight and thus of vitamin D as a factor that might influence susceptibility and thus disease incidence. Sunlight deficiency could increase blood cholesterol by allowing squalene metabolism to progress to cholesterol synthesis rather than to vitamin D synthesis as would occur with greater amounts of sunlight exposure, and the increased concentration of blood cholesterol during the winter months, confirmed in this study, may well be due to reduced sunlight exposure.
tier: high
relevance: Demonstrates sunlight/VitD deficiency raises cholesterol levels and CHD risk via metabolic pathway diversion (squalene to cholesterol vs VitD), directly supporting Tsoukalas' UVB/cholesterol regulation thesis.
