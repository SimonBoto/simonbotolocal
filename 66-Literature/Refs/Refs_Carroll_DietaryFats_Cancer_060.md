  Epidemiological studies suggest that high dietary fat intake may increase risk of certain cancers, particularly breast and colon. Animal studies support this, showing promotion of mammary tumors by high-fat diets. Mechanisms may involve altered hormone levels, bile acids, or free radicals. However, type of fat (saturated vs unsaturated) and overall calorie intake also play roles. [Note: Summary; full via PMID.]
