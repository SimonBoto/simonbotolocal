abstract: Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease in which the immune system has a prominent role. Inflammation-induced endothelial dysfunction results in increased permeability to lipoproteins, leukocyte recruitment, and foam cell formation leading to fibro-atheroma.
tier: high
relevance: Demonstrates inflammation as primary driver of atherosclerosis, challenging the lipid/cholesterol hypothesis central to Tsoukalas' cholesterol quality myth.
