title: Effect of intensive lifestyle intervention on bodyweight and glycaemia in early type 2 diabetes (DIADEM-I): an open-label, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial

abstract: Intensive lifestyle intervention (total diet replacement + physical activity) led to significant weight loss (11.98 kg vs 3.98 kg control) and diabetes remission in 61% vs 12% at 12 months in young early T2D patients from MENA region.
relevance: High; demonstrates feasibility of lifestyle-induced T2D remission in early stages, aligning with metabolomics-targeted interventions for IR reversal.

**Tier**: 1 (RCT)

**DOI**: 10.1016/S2213-8587(20)30117-0 **PMID**: 32445735

**Abstract**: Type 2 diabetes is affecting people at an increasingly younger age, particularly in the Middle East and north Africa. Intensive lifestyle intervention comprising total diet replacement phase followed by structured support resulted in 11.98 kg weight loss vs 3.98 kg usual care, diabetes remission 61% vs 12%, normoglycaemia 33% vs 4%.

**Relevance**: High; first RCT in young early T2D MENA patients showing high remission rates via intensive lifestyle, relevant for PhD on early intervention/metabolomics.

**Source**: Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol 2020 Jun;8(6):477-489.

**Key**: Lifestyle intervention > usual care for remission in early T2D.
