  Analysis shows grass-fed beef tallow has significantly lower total PUFA (1.9% vs 3.45%), 66% less omega-6, 4x more omega-3, and omega-6/omega-3 ratio of 1.4 vs 16+. Grass-fed better aligns with ancestral diets low in PUFA.
tier: 3 (1=high impact, 5=low)
relevance: High relevance to grass-fed fats superiority in omega-3 content; counters grain-fed inflammation risks in Tsoukalas context.

## Abstract
Grass-fed tallow: lower PUFA, better omega balance than grain-fed.

## Key Metabolomics Insights
- Grass-fed fats provide optimal omega ratio, reducing chronic disease risk via lower inflammation.
