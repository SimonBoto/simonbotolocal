  Objective: To examine the relation between frequent consumption of fresh red meat and overall cancer risk. Design: Nationwide cohort study of diet and health with 5 year follow up. Setting: England and Wales. Subjects: 10116 men and 6344 women aged 45-74 years. Main outcome measures: Cancer registrations (12 common sites) and deaths from cancer. Results: 634 cancers were registered among men and 210 among women. Frequent consumption of fresh red meat (eating red meat daily or more than once daily) was not positively associated with overall cancer incidence or mortality after adjustment for potential confounders. Conclusion: Frequent consumption of fresh red meat does not seem to increase cancer risk.
tier: 2 (1=high impact, 5=low)
relevance: Directly supports Tsoukalas claim that red meat not cancer risk; relevant to dietary fats debate.
