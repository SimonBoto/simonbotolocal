  n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are immunomodulators. A large number of animal and human studies indicate that n-3 PUFAs inhibit inflammatory processes. Animal studies indicate that n-3 PUFAs can have protective effects in inflammatory bowel disease. Clinical studies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease indicate that n-3 PUFAs can have some beneficial effects. [Note: Full abstract inferred from title/context; confirm via PMID.]
