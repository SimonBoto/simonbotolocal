title: Serum high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels modify the association between plasma levels of oxidatively modified low-density lipoprotein and coronary artery disease in men

abstract: HDL-C levels interact with the association between plasma Ox-LDL levels and CAD in men, and increased Ox-LDL levels are an indicator of CAD in male subjects with high HDL-C levels. Cases had significantly lower levels of HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-I than controls.
tier: high
relevance: HDL modulates oxidized LDL's role in CAD, emphasizing lipoprotein quality/oxidation over total levels, aligning with cholesterol particle size/quality focus.
