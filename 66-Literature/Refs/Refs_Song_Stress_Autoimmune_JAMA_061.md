abstract: Psychiatric reactions to life stressors are common and may result in immune dysfunction. This cohort study found patients with stress-related disorders were at increased risk of autoimmune disease (HR, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.33-1.40]).
relevance: Direct epidemiological evidence linking stress disorders (PTSD, acute stress reaction, adjustment disorder) to subsequent onset of 41 autoimmune diseases, consistent in sibling comparisons.
