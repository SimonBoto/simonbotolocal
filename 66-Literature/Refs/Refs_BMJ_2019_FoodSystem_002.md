**Tier**: 2 (Review)

**DOI**: 10.1136/bmj.l296

**Abstract**: Malnutrition in all forms, including obesity and micronutrient deficiencies (hidden hunger), drives NCDs. Urgent transformation of food systems is needed to improve production, marketing, and consumption for better nutrition and health outcomes.

**Relevance**: Medium; frames hidden hunger/obesity paradox central to PhD (IR/adipic markers), policy context for metabolomics-driven nutrition.

**Source**: BMJ. Global food system reform to address micronutrient gaps in NCDs (obesity/malnutrition paradox).

**Key**: Hidden hunger + overnutrition → Chronic disease epidemic; policy shift needed.
