title: Dietary micronutrients in the wake of COVID-19: an appraisal of evidence with a focus on high-risk groups and preventative healthcare
authors: McAuliffe S, Ray S, Fallon E, et al.
year: 2020
doi: 10.1136/bmjnph-2020-000100
pmid: 33235973
tier: 2 (Review)
abstract: Micronutrient deficiencies are associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes in high-risk groups (obese, elderly, diabetics). Appraisal of evidence for Zn, Se, Vit D, etc., supports targeted preventative supplementation to mitigate severity, hospitalization, and mortality.
relevance: High; links micronutrient status (VitD) to immune response in metabolic conditions like IR/obesity, relevant for PhD metabolomics (GC-MS biomarkers).
