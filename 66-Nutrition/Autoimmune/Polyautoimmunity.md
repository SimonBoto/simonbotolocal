Polyautoimmunity is the presence of more than one autoimmune disease in the same individual.

Clinical meaning:
- Signals shared upstream drivers (immune tolerance failure + common metabolic/environmental pressures).
- Changes case strategy: look for cross-cutting risk factors instead of treating each diagnosis as isolated.

Common confusion:
- “It’s rare.” It’s clinically common enough to plan for.
- “More diagnoses = worse genetics.” Often reflects persistent modifiable load (barrier, infection burden, stress, deficiencies).
