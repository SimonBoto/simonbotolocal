# BMJ 2024 UPF Umbrella Review

## Abstract Summary
Systematic umbrella review of 45 meta-analyses (9.9M participants). Exposure to ultra-processed foods (Nova classification) linked to 32/45 adverse outcomes (71%).

**Convincing evidence (Class I):**
- CVD mortality: RR 1.50 (1.37-1.63)
- Type 2 diabetes (dose-response): RR 1.12 per serving (1.11-1.13)

**Highly suggestive (Class II):**
- All-cause mortality: RR 1.21
- Heart disease mortality: HR 1.66
- T2D (non-DR): OR 1.40
- Depression: HR 1.22
- Anxiety: OR 1.48
- Mental disorders: OR 1.53
- Sleep issues: OR 1.41
- Wheezing: RR 1.40
- Obesity: OR 1.55

GRADE: Mostly low/very low quality.

## Key Quote
> Greater exposure to ultra-processed food was associated with a higher risk of adverse health outcomes, especially cardiometabolic, common mental disorder, and mortality outcomes.

## Methods
- 45 pooled analyses (13 dose-response).
- Re-analyzed with random effects, I², prediction intervals, Egger's, excess significance.
- Evidence classes I-V; GRADE quality.

## Introduction Highlights
- UPF sales rising globally (42-58% energy in high-income countries).
- Drivers: food environment, marketing.
- Mechanisms: matrix disruption, additives, poor nutrients, inflammation, microbiome.
