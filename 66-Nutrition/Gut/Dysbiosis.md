title: Dysbiosis Definition Clinical Meaning
tags: [nutrition, gut]

Dysbiosis is a clinically meaningful disruption of gut microbiome balance and stability (composition + diversity + functional output), associated with adverse host effects.

Clinical meaning:
- In IBD (Crohn’s / ulcerative colitis), dysbiosis often means community instability, altered relative abundance, and altered microbial metabolite output (e.g., SCFAs) that shift mucosal immune tone.
- Useful when it triggers gated decisions + monitoring.

Common confusion:
- “Dysbiosis = one pathogen” (usually ecosystem pattern).
- “Dysbiosis is always the cause” (cause, consequence, or feedback with inflammation).
