Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is chronic inflammatory GI disorders: Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis; relapsing-remitting inflammation.

Clinical meaning:
- Control mucosal inflammation, prevent complications.
- Fluctuates; multi-factor: genetics + environment + immune + microbiome.

Common confusion:
- “IBD = IBS” (IBS functional, IBD inflammatory).
- “Microbiome only cause” (multi-causal).
