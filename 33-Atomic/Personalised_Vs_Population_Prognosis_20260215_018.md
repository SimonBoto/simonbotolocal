Often when diagnosed with a disease, especially chronic, one might become away of what is called [[disease prognosis]]. 

Extreme confusion can arise when we have incomplete understanding of the disease and when it's course is highly complicated and varies greatly from person to person. 

When diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]] or [[crohn's disease]] for example, there is 30% you never get another episode, 30% you might end to severe progression and 30% the between. This is the [[Df evidence based medicine]] approach and where medication [[cost-effectiveness]] are based on. 

From the 
[[Personalized_Medicine_20260215_020]] viewpoint we focus on each unique person's disease cause, finding and addressing all the [[modifiable factors ]] that may have an effect. 

For example if  have insulin resistance, vitamin d deficiency, B12 and folate marginal deficiency, dysbiosis, a [[Id SAD sitting person]] lifestyle, smoking and you are diagnosed with a chronic disease, it's obsious you have more treatment goals than getting your medication every other week.
