tags: [nutrition, genetics]
---

Epigenetics is the study of heritable or stable changes in gene expression without changing the DNA sequence (e.g., DNA methylation, histone modification).

Clinical meaning:
- Environment (nutrition, inflammation, stress) shifts gene expression.
- Bridge between lifestyle and biological changes.

Common confusion:
- “Epigenetics means you can think genes away.” Effects bounded.
- “Replaces genetics.” Modulates expression.
