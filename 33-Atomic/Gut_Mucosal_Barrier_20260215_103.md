tags: [nutrition, gut]
---

The gut mucosal barrier is the multi-layer defense system (mucus, epithelial cells, tight junctions, immune layer, microbiota) separating intestinal lumen from bloodstream.

Clinical meaning:
- Gatekeeper for antigen exposure; failure increases immune activation.
- Relevant to systemic inflammation, food sensitivity, autoimmune flares.

Common confusion:
- “Just mucus.” Structural + immune + microbial.
- “Leaky gut diagnosis.” Mechanism with proxies/context.
