Claim:
Serum magnesium is an imperfect proxy for whole-body magnesium status; normal serum magnesium does not reliably exclude clinically relevant magnesium deficiency.

Scope (Population/Context):
General clinical inference; especially relevant in chronic stress/inflammation, GI losses, or altered renal handling.

Confidence: Medium (physiology widely accepted; operational thresholds vary)
Failure_Modes:
- If a specific patient population has evidence that serum magnesium correlates strongly with clinically relevant deficiency.
- If “intracellular deficiency” is invoked without operational definition or monitoring.

Mechanism (working model):
Most magnesium is intracellular or stored (bone/soft tissue). Serum magnesium is regulated and may remain “normal” despite tissue depletion, reducing sensitivity for subclinical deficiency.

Implications:
- Avoid binary interpretation: “serum normal = no deficiency.”
- Use a multi-signal inference model (risk factors + symptoms + confounders + monitored response).
- Document confounders (diarrhea, diet pattern, high stress load, meds affecting Mg balance).

Needs_Evidence: yes
Open_Loops:
- Extract 2–3 quantitative anchors (distribution + limitations) once the physiology review is captured.
Promote_to_stable_when:
- One library note contains extracted support + we add an internal clinic operational interpretation line.
