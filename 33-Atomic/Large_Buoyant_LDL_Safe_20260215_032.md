# Large Buoyant LDL Particles Protective Against CVD

**Claim**: Large, buoyant LDL (Pattern A) anti-atherogenic/protective; opposite of small dense.

**Evidence**: Tsoukalas: NMR/GC-MS shows large LDL neutral/safe; Framingham low density risk only small particles.

- Test quality: [[33-Atomic/Particle_Quality_Test_20260215_034]]
- PhD: Adipic favors large? [[33-Atomic/Adipic_Cholesterol_IR_20260215_035]]
