The gut–brain axis is the bidirectional communication network between the gut (microbiome, mucosa, enteric nervous system) and the central nervous system via neural, immune, endocrine, and metabolic signaling.

Clinical meaning:
- Explains gut perturbations manifesting as mood, fatigue, sleep, cognition changes.
- Stress changes motility, secretion, permeability, microbial ecology.

Common confusion:
- “It’s just serotonin.” Includes immune/metabolic signals.
- “Psychological stress only.” Often trigger on metabolic/barrier load.
