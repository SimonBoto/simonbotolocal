Vitamin D synthesis is the skin-based production of vitamin D3 initiated by UV-B radiation converting 7-dehydrocholesterol into previtamin D3, followed by thermal isomerization to vitamin D3 and later activation steps in liver and kidney.

Clinical meaning:
- Sun exposure conditions (UV-B availability, sunscreen, glass, latitude/season) strongly affect endogenous D3 production.
- Low endogenous synthesis is common in modern indoor living, pushing reliance on dietary/supplement sources.

Common confusion:
- “Sun through glass works.” UV-B is largely blocked by typical window glass.
- “Sunscreen has no effect.” Strong sunscreens can reduce UV-B driven synthesis.
