Autoimmunity is an immune state in which tolerance to “self” is reduced and immune responses (including autoantibodies and autoreactive T-cells) target the body’s own tissues.

Clinical meaning:
- Autoimmune diseases are organ-specific expressions of dysregulated immune signaling plus upstream drivers (metabolic state, barriers, triggers).
- Course is often relapsing-remitting and trigger-sensitive (infections, stress, diet/exposures).
- “Autoimmune” is not one mechanism; it is a family of failure modes.

Common confusion:
- “It’s purely genetic.” Genetics loads the gun; environment often pulls the trigger.
- “One autoimmune = one organ.” Polyautoimmunity is common; shared risk stacks matter.
