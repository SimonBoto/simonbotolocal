According to these criteria, three characteristics are proposed: (1) clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism or both, (2) oligo-anovulation, and (3) polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) (ultrasonography indicating the presence of ≥12 follicles with a maximum diameter of 2–9 mm or any ovarian volume >10 mL). A woman with PCOS must meet at least two of the three characteristics, and other causes of hyperandrogenism, such as nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia and hyperprolactinemia, must be ruled out [5].” Yellow Highlight [Page ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ARNCRCBR?page=&annotation=SQ4HDKI8)
