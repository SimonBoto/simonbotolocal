# Definition (simple)
**Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol)** is the precursor (“pro-hormone”) form of vitamin D made in skin from sunlight and used in supplements.

# Clinical meaning (how we frame it)
- We treat D3 as a **system regulator** with broad downstream effects.
- D3 dosing guided by *function + safety gates*, not only by “normal ranges.”

# Common confusion
- Confusing D3 (precursor) with activated forms (e.g., calcitriol).  
  Different risk profiles and different use-cases.
- Thinking “higher number = toxicity.” In our approach, **safety gates override target-chasing**.
