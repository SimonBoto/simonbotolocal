Definition:
Cobalamin (vitamin B12) is a water-soluble B vitamin required for key methylation and mitochondrial reactions. It contains cobalt at its core (a corrin ring complex).

Clinical meaning:
- Central to [[One_Carbon_Metabolism]] via methionine synthase (supports methylation capacity).
- Required for conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA → succinyl-CoA (mitochondrial metabolism; links B12 to fatigue/neurology when low).
- Supports [[DNA_Synthesis]] and normal hematopoiesis; deficiency can present with neurological symptoms even without anemia.

Common confusion:
- “Serum B12 is enough.” Serum can be misleading; functional markers often add clarity.
- “Folate fixes everything.” Folate can mask hematologic signs while neurological issues progress if B12 remains low.

Diagnosis (functional pattern):
- Elevated [[Metabolite_Methylmalonic_Acid]] suggests impaired B12-dependent metabolism (classically rises with B12 deficiency).
- Elevated [[Homocysteine]] can reflect low B12 and/or folate/B6 issues (interpret in context).
- [[Plasma_Measurement_B12]] is a starting point, not always decisive alone.
