Fat-soluble vitamins are vitamins that dissolve in fat and are stored to varying degrees in body tissues. Classically: A, D, E, K.

Clinical meaning:
- Storage creates a different safety profile vs water-soluble vitamins: accumulation is possible, so therapeutic dosing often needs monitoring and clear indications.
- “Form matters” concept:
  - Pro-vitamin forms (inactive precursors) can be safer in certain contexts because activation is regulated.
  - Active forms can behave more like drugs and require tighter oversight.

Common confusion:
- "All vitamins are the same safety-wise." No—solubility and form change pharmacokinetics.
- "Fat-soluble means toxic." Not inherently; it means monitoring and dose-context matter.
