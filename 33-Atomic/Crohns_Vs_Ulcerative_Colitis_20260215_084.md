Crohn’s and UC differ by distribution/depth.

- **Distribution**: UC: colon continuous from rectum; Crohn’s: any GI, skip lesions.
- **Depth**: UC: mucosal/submucosal; Crohn’s: transmural (strictures/fistulas).

Implications: Different complications/therapies.

Common confusion:
- “UC no systemic” (has extra-intestinal).
- “Crohn’s always colon-sparing” (Crohn’s colitis exists).
