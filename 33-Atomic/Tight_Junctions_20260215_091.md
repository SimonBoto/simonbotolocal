Tight junctions are protein complexes between intestinal epithelial cells regulating paracellular permeability.

Clinical meaning:
- Disruption increases antigen/microbial passage, amplifying immune signaling.
- Related to intestinal permeability, inflammatory cascades.

Common confusion:
- “Open/close like doors.” Graded via signaling/inflammation.
- “One marker proves leaky gut.” Multi-signal context.
