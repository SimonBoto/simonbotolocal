title: Magnesium Deficiency Definition Clinical Meaning
tags: [nutrition, vitamins, minerals, magnesium]
---

Serum magnesium is an imperfect proxy for whole-body magnesium status; normal serum magnesium does not reliably exclude clinically relevant magnesium deficiency.

Scope: General clinical inference; especially relevant in chronic stress/inflammation, GI losses, or altered renal handling.

Mechanism:
Most magnesium is intracellular or stored (bone/soft tissue). Serum magnesium is regulated and may remain “normal” despite tissue depletion.

Implications:
- Avoid binary interpretation.
- Use multi-signal inference (risk factors + symptoms + confounders + response).
