Problem: Lack of Understanding Therapeutic Diets (Patients and Dietitians)

Solution: Training Material 

1. Understanding Macronutrients: Essential Protein & Fat, Carbohydrates not essential and excess consumption is root to insulin resistance 
2. Nutrient Density and Micronutrients. Priority Foods: Red Meat from Ruminants, Eggs, Seafood, Fish 
4. Saturated fats and the cholesterol myth: Eat the Egg yolks, Butter, Cheese, Coconut and Oil, Oilves and Olive oil, Avocados and Oil
5. The problem with wholegrains: Non-Nutrient and anti-nutrients are very high when not fermented - when it's not sourdough. Also even though they have lower glycaemic index, their glycaemic load remains the same. 
6. Beware of Oxalte Toxicity: Avoid Spinach, Hazelnut, Peanut & Peanutbutter, Cashew & Milk, Almonds & Milk. Nightshades have to be peeled and their seeds should be removed: Tomatoes, Eggplants, Peppers - Eath with Olive oil, Cheese and ACV. If you love almonds soak overnight, peel and then consume with modesty.
